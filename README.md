# maptodon

maptodon is an open-source ecosystem that enables individuals and communities to easily create, update, and view detailed, 3D maps. Utilizing an iOS app for efficient scanning, a sophisticated AI pipeline for 3D data generation, and a user-friendly web app for viewing, maptodon is at the forefront of democratizing 3D mapping.
