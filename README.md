# Maptodon AI Pipeline

This project contains the pipeline for performing 3D reconstruction using [Hierarchical-Localization](https://github.com/cvg/Hierarchical-Localization) and [COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/), then [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/) on images. The pipeline includes notebook which install necessary libraries and dependencies, preparing input images, performing structure from motion (SfM), and 3D reconstruction, running COLMAP image undistorter, and performing Gaussian splatting training.
